# Spawncamp

Spawncamp is ~~nobody's~~ everyone's favorite tool to use during **first pass enrollment**
at UCSD. It will automatically enroll you in one of the sections you specify when an opening is found and push a desktop notification (remove notificaiton if you want)

Most useful for people with bad enrollment times and have to deal with full classes before even getting
a chance to enroll. 

This thing actually got me a spot in CSE 151A lol.

## Setup

### Prerequisites:

Spawncamp only works on Windows because I don't have a mac to test a potential macOS version***
If you are on a mac you can remove the notifications and replace them with whatever you want.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo onto your local machine
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the home directory of the repository.
3. Edit the script to monitor the class you're trying to get in.

### Usage

1. Edit the script to monitor the class you're trying to get in.
2. Sign into Webreg on Google Chrome, you may need to sign in again later when
   the cookies expire.
3. Run :)
